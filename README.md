# Allow Aliases for YOURLS

This plugin allows YOURLS to work with alias hostnames for the server.  

This plugin is useful when you change the hostname of your server but
you still want the old hostname/s to continue working (assuming the old
hostname/s is/are still correctly configured in DNS).

It also allows you to use YOURLS with your server's IP address.

#### Example use case:

1. Old hostname was `toolong.hostname.com`
2. Hostname changed to `sho.rt` (`toolong.hostname.com` still in DNS)
3. Install and activate the `allow-aliases` plugin
4. The following should now work:
    * `http://sho.rt/yourls`
    * `http://toolong.hostname.com/yourls`
    * `http://<IP address>/yourls`
    * `http://<any other alias>/yourls`

#### Instructions:

1. Copy the `allow-aliases` folder to `user/plugins/`.
2. Activate the plugin in the YOURLS admin interface.

That's it.
